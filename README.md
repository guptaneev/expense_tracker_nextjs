# Personal Expense Tracker

The Personal Expense Tracker provides a simple interface for adding transactions to track a budget. Users can add, view, and manage their transactions through the Prisma ORLM with Neon Postgres for data storage. The application dynamically updates the balance, income, and expenses, all linked to a secure sign-in and authentication with Clerk.
